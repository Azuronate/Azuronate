<h1 align="center">Interdisciplinary Software Engineering Student</h1>



Through the expansive world, curiosity and my interdisciplinary approach drive passion into creating digital experiences for all. Combining design, software development, IT, and science, I strive to build reliable technological systems that not only solve real-world problems but are also well-documented. Throughout my life, I’ve always taken education seriously, especially when it comes to the technology of the world today. As such, I was awarded as a 2025 Lilly Endowment Community Scholar from Dearborn County (Indiana), for the seriousness, dedication, and passion I continue to show in my learning.

I’m currently a student at Indiana University Bloomington, pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science (Software Engineering). As a result, most of my GitHub commits will be locked behind a GitHub Education account and will not be visible to the public. To track my progress/activity, you can view my public [Code::Stats](https://codestats.net/users/Azuronate) account and see whenever I am programming.
